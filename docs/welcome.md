Sierra Dev is your gateway to building powerful investigation tools and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) scripts with ease.
</div>

## 🎯 What is Sierra Dev?

Think of Sierra Dev as a **smart framework** that helps you:

1. **Build investigation tools** - Create scripts that gather, analyze, and visualize data
2. **Package and share** - Distribute your tools like apps in an app store
3. **Use pre-built tools** - Install 15+ ready-to-use OSINT tools instantly
4. **Automate workflows** - Chain tools together for complex investigations

### Real-World Example

Imagine you want to investigate a website. Instead of manually checking:
- Who owns the domain
- What technologies it uses
- Its server location
- Historical versions

You can run **one command** that does all of this automatically and presents results in a beautiful table!
